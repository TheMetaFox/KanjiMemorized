# KanjiMemorized
 An app to help me study Japanese.

 The plan is for this app to focus on assisting with memorizing Kanji through the use of decomposition. This approach will start with memorizing the 214 radicals, then continue by using them as stepping stones/puzzle pieces to memorizing more complex Kanji.

 Similarly to Anki, a spaced repetition system will be used for optimum learning efficiency. In addition to a flashcard mode however, you'll beable to study through other quiz types, like multiple choice. It is also important to note that the degree of success of an answer will be calculated automatically. This way you don't have to worry about whether a certain response was 'hard', 'good', or 'easy'.
